  Why does she think they're very good?

      <em> Eventhough </em> my music taste is all over the place I belive that these songs are the best, at least for me.
  They just sound so good too me and make me happy listening too them. I love songs that make me wanna move, expect for broken clocks because, it is kind of a sad song at least for me. </body>
